                                <h1>Feeling Scratchy</h1><br>Bored on a sunny Lebanese summer day, I asked my
                                father for something to do, and was introduced to <a
                                    href="https://www.scratch.mit.edu">Scratch</a>. Here, I learned so much about the
                                essential foundations of programming and computational thought. Little did I know that
                                the rest of my life would be spent in the world of code.<br><br>What I learned from
                                Scratch was that I loved to create things, and that I loved to learn. I created so many
                                games and animations, and I was hooked. Sprites became a part of my life, and I was in
                                love with the idea of creating something from nothing.
                            </span></div>

                                <h1>Snakes in Boots</h1><br>In 2015, I completed a <a
                                    href="https://www.pierian.com">course</a> from Pierian Data on python and learned
                                everything from the ground up. I built so many programs and wasted so much time on IDLE
                                creating adventure and novel games. I fell in love with creating something from nothing. 
                                I was hooked.<br><br>
                                Leaving what felt like an impractical platform like Scratch to Python was a big step, 
                                but I am happy to have taken it. I learned so much about building and creating, 
                                and I am forever grateful that I took that step and pushed myself further than I thought 
                                I could go.

                                <h1>App Dev</h1><br>Around 2017, I started to get really interested in app development,
                                and to that end, I learned <b>Swift, Flutter, SwiftUI, Bootstrap, and Dart.</b> In
                                December of 2019, I landed a
                                keynote presentation at <b>Apple's</b> Today@Apple program as a guest speaker talking
                                about my
                                journey into iOS app development and helped audience members create their very first
                                app!
                                <br><br>I also founded the IDJ, an online platform of iOS developers who help each other
                                get
                                started and answer any questions they might have. I learned so much about leadership and
                                inclusion while fulfilling that role.

                                <br>While I was in quarantine, I realized that what I truly felt passion for was
                                Education. I wanted to help spread the knowledge and skills I accumulated over years of
                                hard work and dedication to as much people as I could.<br><br> I joined dozens of online
                                communities over discord and started teaching a class around the foundations of
                                programming and spent hours shaping the curriculum to each student in the class. It was
                                truly an incredible thing to be part of. Education is the future, and I'm so excited to
                                be a part of it and I'm incredibly excited to leverage computer science to create an
                                impact.

                                <h1>Creating Impact</h1><br>In 2022, I decided to jump in headfirst and complete a 6
                                month internship with <a href="https://massarat.com">Massarat</a> a startup in Lebanon
                                that is at the forefront of assessments and ed-tech globally. During my internship, I was
                                responsible for the iOS application; I migrated API's, worked on the front end, and also
                                provided feedback from a student perspective only being 16 years old.<br><br>What
                                Massarat taught me was that the real world was not different than my desk. I learned
                                that I could affect change in my community from my study desk and that I didn't need a
                                bachelor's degree to do so.

                                <h1>Whats <i>next?</i></h1><br>In 2024, I was met with an incredibly tough decision: <b>Carnegie Mellon</b> or <b>Harvard</b>. 
                                This decision pushed me to really consider what I wanted from higher education and 
                                what kind of environment would best support my goals. CMU was renowned for its cutting-edge research 
                                facilities and strong focus on technology and innovation, which aligned perfectly with my interest 
                                in pursuing a career in CS. On the other hand, Harvard’s rich academic tradition and its vast network 
                                of distinguished alumni offered a different set of advantages.
                                <br><br>
                                I chose Carnegie Mellon University. The decision wasn't easy, and I grappled with the idea of 
                                missing out on the broader academic experience Harvard offered. However, CMU's leadership as the #1 CS program, 
                                and the chance to work directly with leading researchers ultimately swayed me.

                            then, I have worked on being formless; I have learned over 15 languages and frameworks and
                            have most importantly developed an ability to think both analytically and critically.</p>
